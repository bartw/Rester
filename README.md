Description
-
Rester is a Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 library for talking to restful api's. I'm building Rester instead of using an existing library because I want to learn about restful api's.
Rester is under heavy development and by no means stable. If you are looking for a stable restclient I suggest you use [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/).
Disclaimer
-
Rester is a hobby project that I do because I love developing. I do however have a life and family. Therefore I can't give any guarantees about deadlines, crashes or any other problems.
